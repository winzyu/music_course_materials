TITLE: Learning Objectives

CONTENT:
Learn about the development of African American music from African roots through the artists of today.  
Learn something about the variety of musical forms within African American music: spirituals, minstrelsy, gospel, soul, R&B, Motown, funk, disco and rap. Be able to recognize some of the features of the different genres of music, such as rhythms, bass lines, song forms, and vocal styles.  
Learn about where the different varieties of African American music came from; understand the social, political, and economic conditions that gave rise to the music, as well as the factors that influenced its development, including significant events in African-American history from roughly 1860 through today.  
Be able to talk about music in relation to cultural history: this is truly one of the main goals of the course, to provide students with the analytical and synthetic tools to be able to discuss music in relation to other cultural forms. 
Be able to analyze visual representations associated with the varieties of African American music, especially with respect to artists. We will explore the visual components of the construction of race, gender, and class in the context of African American musical artists.
Get acquainted with some African American artists: provide students with an introduction to some of the greats and hope that they are inspired to listen to more.   
•Learn to identify certain artists and styles when you hear them.  Acquire a vocabulary to describe musical performance.

Inland from the coast of Ghana the bush is dense for I 50 miles. According to the vegetation maps, the tropical rain forest thins out in Ghana, and, compared with Sierra Leone or parts of Ivory Coast or Nigeria, is even considered to be non-existent. But to the visitor, even though primal forest probably survives nowhere in the country, the lush vegetation, the huge leaves like elephants' ears, the soaring, unstable cotton trees com­bine to give an impression of congested and barely tamed growth. Laterite roads, red and hard, raising clouds of choking dust under the wheels of a 'mammy wagon' in the dry season, deeply rutted, saturated and often impassably flooded in the rainy season, wind through the forest. Nar­rower paths and twisting tracks lead off into the bush to villages of laterite mud houses and thatched markets. From these can be heard the rumble and thunder of the drums through the hours of the night and a soft roar of village voices. Above them, clear and penetrating, the sharp clacking of the 'gong-gong' strikes a persistent, unflagging pattern until daybreak. 
Driving through the bush one may happen upon a celebration; more often it can be heard from a distant and hidden village unlocated in the deceptive acoustics of the bush. Occasions like these are often the wakes and successive celebrations which are held at intervals after the death of a member of the community. In Ashanti the number of functions and occasions when the villagers gather for dancing are numerous: puberty festivals, meetings of hunter and warrior associations, religious festivals

TITLE: Academic Honesty

CONTENT:
What constitutes academic dishonesty?  There are many ways to short-circuit the academic learning process.  For a clear explanation of academic honesty, integrity, and fairness, you are required to read the code of Academic Conduct at http://sja.ucdavis.edu/files/cac.pdf (also included in the files on Canvas).  

It is important to do your own work.  What is wrong with using someone else’s work?  Learning requires a series of stages and steps that cannot be skipped.  It is a process.  If you use someone else’s work you do not learn and grow.  You also have an unfair advantage over other students in the class.  In the end, you only cheat yourself by not taking the opportunity to learn through guided practice, trial and error and old-fashioned hard work. 

Academic dishonesty can take many forms.  Plagiarism is the unattributed (uncited) use of another writer’s work, specific language and/or ideas.  Unauthorized collaboration involves working with another student in the class and sharing answers on an assignment that was intended for individual work.  Cheating with notes, a cell phone or any other unauthorized source of information during a test or in-class assignment represents another form of academic dishonesty.  Outside help with a written or oral assignment, from a friend, tutor, parent, or teacher, constitutes another form of dishonesty.
