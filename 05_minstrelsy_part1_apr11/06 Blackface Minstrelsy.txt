TITLE: Rise of Black Minstrels Post-Civil War

CONTENT:
Minstrelsy was, on the whole, a caricature of Negro life, and it fixed a stage tradition which has not yet been broken. It fixed the tradition of the Negro as only an irresponsible, happy-go-lucky, wide grinning, loud laughing, shuffling, banjo-playing singing, dancing sort of being. Nevertheless, the companies did provide stage training and theatrical experience for a large number of coloured men . . . which, at the time, could not have been acquired from any other source.
