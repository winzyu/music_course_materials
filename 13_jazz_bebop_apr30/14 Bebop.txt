CONTENT:
“Bebop, created by a small group of black musicians who migrated to the city during the Depression, anticipating the massive movement of the second great migration during the war, created an expressive and technically complex music that belonged to them. During the war they worked out a new set of conventions that shaped jazz in its many variations for the next generation, By restoring the role of blues-based improvisation, these modern jazz revolutionaries insisted on receiving cultural as well as financial credit for their music. When Parker, Gillespie, Davis, Roach, and Russell recorded “Ko-Ko” in the late fall of 1945, they stepped out of obscurity into the spotlight of public notice.” (116)
