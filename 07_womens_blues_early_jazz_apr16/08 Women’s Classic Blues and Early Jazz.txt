=== SLIDE 1 ===
TITLE: Women’s Classic Blues and Early Jazz


=== SLIDE 2 ===
TITLE: The Blues and Minstrel Shows

CONTENT:
Allen’s New Orleans Minstrels, the Rabbit’s Foot Company, and Silas Green from New Orleans all carried blues singing specialists in 1915.  In 1916 the blues specialist with the Florida Blossom Minstrels was Bessie Smith. By the end of the decade all African American minstrel companies were expected to carry at least one ‘real blues singer’; from the 1920s onward, minstrel shows were a primary platform for ‘classic’ female blues singers.


=== SLIDE 3 ===
TITLE: The Blues and Minstrel Shows

CONTENT:
By the middle of the decade, blues had become a special attraction that sustained the popularity of African American entertainers under the sideshow tent. 
Blues singing had begun to make a permanent home in tented minstrelsy.  W. C. Handy’s early blues compositions, particularly “St. Louis Blues,” “Hesitation Blues,” and the vocal version of “The Memphis Blues,” initiated the trend.

TITLE: “Prove It on Me Blues”

CONTENT:
Went out last night, had a great big fightEverything seemed to go on wrongI looked up, to my surpriseThe gal I was with was gone
Where she went, I don't knowI mean to follow everywhere she goes;Folks say I'm crooked. I didn't know where she took itI want the whole world to know
They say I do it, ain't nobody caught meSure got to prove it on me;Went out last night with a crowd of my friendsThey must've been women, 'cause I don't like no men
